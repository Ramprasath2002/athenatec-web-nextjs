          <p>
            Engagement of Athena Technology Solutions for professional services
            is governed by separate, executed agreements between Athena and the
            client organization. These Terms do not supersede or replace such

            <li>
              <strong>Master Service Agreements (MSA):</strong> All
              professional engagements require an executed MSA outlining scope,
              responsibilities, payment terms, warranties, and dispute
              resolution procedures.

              <strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Clients in regulated
              industries (e.g., medical devices under FDA 21 CFR Part 11) are
              responsible for ensuring their own regulatory compliance. Athena
              provides implementation expertise but does not assume regulatory
              responsibility on behalf of clients.
